# Frontend Setup Guide

## Quick Setup

The frontend is missing some dependencies and files. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Missing Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
npm install redux-persist @heroicons/react
```

### Step 2: Install All Dependencies (if needed)

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start the Frontend

```bash
npm start
```

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Created missing public folder files:**
- `public/index.html` - Main HTML template
- `public/manifest.json` - Web app manifest
- `public/robots.txt` - Search engine robots file

✅ **Added missing dependencies to package.json:**
- `redux-persist` - For persisting Redux state
- `@heroicons/react` - For icons

## Expected Result

After running the setup, you should see:
```
✅ Compiled successfully!
✅ You can now view booking-management-frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://192.168.x.x:3000

✅ Note that the development build is not optimized.
✅ To create a production build, use npm run build.
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Clear cache:**
   ```bash
   npm start -- --reset-cache
   ```

2. **Delete node_modules and reinstall:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. **Check backend is running:**
   - Backend should be on http://localhost:5000
   - Test with: http://localhost:5000/health
